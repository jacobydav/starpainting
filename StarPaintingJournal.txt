5/21/17 Keywords: Update, TinyFlash library

I am trying to organize my documentation on the StarPainting.
Here are the major milestones:
1. Version 1 of the painting used a 555 timer to turn on and off the different color LEDs
2. Some years later I upgraded the painting using a TLC5971 board. This board can control the brightness of the LEDs.
	I used a Trinket microcontroller to communicate with the TLC5971. There was an Arduino library for using the LTC5971
	but it only worked on full size Arduinos such as UNOs. So I took an Adafruit library called TinyFlashLibrary which
	has some SPI (serial peripehery interface) functions and modified it to work with the TLC5971.
	
	The modified TinyFlash library is located in Code\Libraries\ModifiedByMe\Adafruit_TinyFlash.
	I started to create a separate library called Trinket_TLC_LED that would be only for the Trinket and TLC5971 but
	I never completed it.
	
	I also added an external controller for the painting which turns on the painting automatically when it is dark
	and motion is detected. This controller is run by a separate Trinket.
	
So at this point, the code files in use are: 

Code\StarPaintingLED_Trinket\StarPaintingLED_Trinket.ino
Code\Libraries\ModifiedByMe\Adafruit_TinyFlash

and I used Arduino IDE 1.6.4
